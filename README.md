# CGI Case and Reference Expert

Checkout in GitHub CoPilot and describe to GPT a case you would like to find references for. The languages model will start researching all public Case Studies and References on all CGI global and country websites, based on your description and will create an HTML file to present to your client and a draft e-mail that you can use to send it.

The sumarized information should be in CEFR B2-level language so that it's easy to comprehend by you and your client.
All references will be founded by links to the CGI website.

Current implementation is in Dutch, but you can just ask it to answer in English, German etc.
